# About

This repository is used to synchronize local `.md` files with articles in my [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/yxm). The synchronization is made using the Github Action [sinedied/publish-devto](https://github.com/sinedied/publish-devto), which is called every time a new commit is made. This, in turn, is automated using the workflow [.github/workflows/publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml).

# Contents

Here (and in my [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/yxm)) you will find columns on the following topics:
